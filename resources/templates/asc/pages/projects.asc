Here are some personal projects/open source contributions:

=== Riemann

I'm a regular contributor to the http://riemann.io/[Riemann] project and its ecosystem. +

Riemann is an amazing stream processing engine for monitoring. You push events to Riemann, and it can calculate statistics on the fly (percentiles, rate, combine events from differents hosts...), do alerting, forward events and alerts to external systems (Graphite, InfluxDB, Elasticsearch, Pagerduty...), and a lot more !

I work on Riemann itself, and its ecosystem (clients in differents langages (Go, Clojure, Java,..), integration with other monitoring tools, documentation and helping users...).

I also wrote a couple of Riemann plugins:

- https://github.com/mcorbin/riemann-cond-dt-plugin[riemann-cond-dt]: A plugin for verifying that a condition on an event is true during a time period.
-  https://github.com/mcorbin/riemann-discovery/[riemann-discovery]: Basic service discovery for Riemann

=== Clojure

I love Clojure. It's a fun, fast, powerful language but not very well known (especially in France where nothing exists outside of Java/Javascript).

- http://tour.mcorbin.fr[Tour of Clojure] (https://github.com/mcorbin/tour-of-clojure[repo here]) is a interactive Clojure tutorial, currently only available in French (PR welcome for adding more lang !). Still work in progress !
- https://github.com/mcorbin/webtemplate[webtemplate] is a leiningen template for creating Clojure web app using compojure and mount. Still evolving.

=== My infrastructure

My websites are deployed in Exoscale using Terraform and Ansible. Everything is open source:
- https://github.com/mcorbin/personal-terraform[My Terraform configuration]
- https://github.com/mcorbin/personal-ansible[My Ansible configuration]

=== Ansible roles and plugins

I use Ansible at my job almost everyday, and i decided to start sharing some Ansible roles and plugins:

- I wrote https://github.com/mcorbin/goss-ansible[goss-ansible], an Ansible module for https://github.com/aelsabbahy/goss[goss] at one of my previous job. It's a cool module for test driven infrastructure.
- I wrote an https://github.com/mcorbin/haproxy-ansible-role[HAProxy role] for Debian.
- Some roles will arrive soon.

=== IRC logs

I save syslog-ng and Riemann #freenode channels at http://irc-logs.ovh/[http://irc-logs.ovh/]. I used https://tools.suckless.org/ii/[ii], stunnel, nginx, cron, and an ugly shell script to do it. I plan to do something better when i found the time.
